# Wall Text Experiment

This is an experiment in how we might engage with art and language outside the confines of the wall label. It draws on a background in philosophy, art history, and writing—and a belief that sometimes the most resonant interpretations are the ones we’re never explicitly told.

The project presents semi-random pairings of artworks and textual fragments: poetry, literary prose, theory, and aphorisms. These connections are not instructional. They are intuitive, suggestive—designed to encourage reflection, not resolve meaning.

By pairing, say, a Claude Cahun self-portrait with a line from Anne Carson, the hope is not to interpret but to evoke: something about identity, resistance, intimacy—maybe. Or something else entirely, depending on who’s looking.

Sources remain hidden by default. You can reveal them—but not before encountering the image and the text as they are, without mediation. This is about returning, however briefly, to what Sontag called the “innocence before all theory.”

We welcome your quiet thoughts, contradictions, and resonances. This space is meant for looking slowly and thinking sideways.
